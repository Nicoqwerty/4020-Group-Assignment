        <p>This project brings together a clean website with a backend experiment that looks at how well ChatGPT performs in different subject areas. On the front end, it uses hash-based client-side routing, responsive design, and some interactive and dynamic elements to create a smooth user experience. On the back end, we tested ChatGPT using Node.js server, MongoDB, and WebSockets to measure its accuracy and response time. Altogether, the project shows both the design side of web development and the practical side of evaluating an AI model.</p>
