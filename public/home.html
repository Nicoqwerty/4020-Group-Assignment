        <p>This project combines modern web design with an evaluation of ChatGPT’s efficiency across different domains. The website showcases client-side routing, responsive UI design, and interactive features, while also documenting how ChatGPT was tested using Node.js, MongoDB, WebSockets, and the ChatGPT API. Overall, it connects both front-end creativity and back-end analysis into one unified project.</p>
