            <h2>Hello, I'm John Laurence Mislang</h2>
            <p>A York University student studying Information Technology with a focus on Cybersecurity. I've always been fascinated by computers and technology since I was young.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a rural area in the Philippines and my journey into IT really only started when I arrived here in Canada back in 2018. I have only watched videos about different technologies before coming here and my interest only grew stronger after having access to unlimited internet and building my very own first computer back in 2022.</p>
            <p>I try to dabble in a little bit of everything that interests me; mainly video games, animations/3D modelling, and recently cybersecurity as well. Some projects that I have done can be seen in my Projects page.</p>
